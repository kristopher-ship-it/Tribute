    <h3 id="headline">A timeline of Stephen Hawking's remarkable life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1942</strong><dt><strong>HAWKING WAS BORN</strong></dt> - Born in Oxford, England</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1959</strong><dt><strong>OXFORD UNIVERSITY</strong></dt> - At only 17 years old, Hawking begins studying physics at Oxford University. Finding the work quite easy, Hawking studies very little. During his last year of study, Hawking becomes increasingly clumsy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1962</strong><dt><strong>FIRST-CLASS HONORS DEGREE</strong></dt> - After receiving a first-class honors degree in natural science from Oxford, Hawking starts his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1963</strong><dt><strong>MEETS FUTURE WIFE</strong></dt> - While attending a party, Hawking meets Jane Wilde, a languages undergraduate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1963</strong><dt><strong>DIAGNOSIS</strong></dt> - Just shy of his 21st birthday, Hawking is diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) â€“ a rare disease that affects movement and speech. He is told he is only likely to live for two more years.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1965</strong><dt><strong>MARRIAGE</strong></dt> - Jane and Stephen marry. They have three children together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1965</strong><dt><strong>THESIS</strong></dt> - Hawking writes his thesis based on applying Roger Penrose's theory of space-time singularity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1966</strong><dt><strong>ADAMS PRIZE</strong></dt> - Hawking's essay Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time wins him the Adams Prize.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1970</strong><dt><strong>DISCOVERS HOLE DYNAMICS</strong></dt> - Hawking discovers The Second Law of Black Hole Dynamics. Using quantum theory and general relativity, Hawking reveals that black holes can emit radiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1975</strong><dt><strong>GOLD MEDAL FOR SCIENCE</strong></dt> - Pope Paul VI awards Hawking the Pius XI Gold Medal for Science.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1977</strong><dt><strong>GRAVITATIONAL PHYSICS PROFESSOR</strong></dt> - Hawking is appointed as professor of gravitational physics at Cambridge.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1978</strong><dt><strong>HONORARY DOCTORATE</strong></dt> - The University of Oxford awards Hawking an honorary doctorate.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>2004</strong><dt><strong>SOLVES THE BLACK HOLE PARADOX</strong></dt> - Announcing that he has solved the Black Hole paradox, Hawking presents his recent findings at the international conference on general relativity and gravitation in Dublin.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2012</strong><dt><strong>FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS PRIZE</strong></dt> - Hawking is awarded the Fundamental Physics Prize, winning $3 million for his theory on the ability for black holes to emit energy
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2014</strong><dt><strong>THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING</strong></dt> - A film about the life of Hawking and Jane Wilde is released, staring Eddie Redmayne as Hawking.
      </li>
      <li><strong>2018</strong><dt><strong>PASSES AWAY</strong></dt> - Hawking's family confirmed he had died peacefully.</li>
